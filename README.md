## Description

Trivia Fighter Turbo is a browser-based trivia game. Players try to maximize their score by answering a upto 20 questions right, before the timer runs out. If a player can get a top score, they are prompted to add their name into the leaderboard.

## Context

Computer games have become an integral part of our daily lives now. From big platform productions like God of War to addictive smartphone essentials like Farmville, there are millions of cool games to choose from. Unfortunately, I feel like it is still hard to find titles that can replicate the excitement and the amusement retro arcade games.

I was looking for ideas to practise my [JAMStack](https://jamstack.org/) skills. That is why I decided to revitilize an [old project](https://github.com/cemergin/TRIVIA-FIGHTER-TURBO) where I tried paying homage to "the good old days" by creating a SMS-based arcade-style trivia game.

Developed in part due to [the Udemy Programming Challenge](https://github.com/udemy/coding-challenge)

## Under the Hood

### Features

- Get Questions from [Open Trivia DB](https://opentdb.com/)
- Round Timer
- Calculate Score
- Insert Score to Leaderboard DB
- Get Leaderboard from DB
- Display DB

### Front-End

The game is developed using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) which is a PWA generator that uses [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). The static files generated by [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) are hosted by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

- [index.js](./src/pages/index.js) => A static landing page
- [play.js](./src/pages/play.js) => **Where the magic happens**
- [leaderboard.js](./src/pages/leaderboard.js) => Players can view the list of highest ranked players here
- [404.js](./src/pages/404.js) => 404 Error Page with a Street Fighter reference

The pages are based on [React's](https://reactjs.org/) functional components. useState and useEffect hooks are used heavly on [play.js](./src/pages/play.js) and [leaderboard.js](./src/pages/leaderboard.js) in conjunction with the API calls to the [Lambda functions](./functions) to make the application come alive.

**[gatsby-starter-default](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default/)** was used to initialize this project. The basic layout that comes with the starter code is used almost as is with the adition of some in-line CSS here and there.

### Back-End

Trivia Fighter Turbo makes use of the Lambda functions and serverless architecture provided by Netlify. The client makes request to the Netlify functions that acts as the Back-End, to perform 3 distinct operations:

- [leaderboard.js](./functions/leaderboard.js) => Get current leaderboard from [Hasura Database](https://hasura.io/)
- [questions.js](./functions/questions.js) => Generate questions using [Open Trivia DB API](https://opentdb.com/)
- [insertScore.js](./functions/insertScore.js) => Insert new player and score into [Hasura Database](https://hasura.io/)

The database is fairly simple. There is only one table called 'leaderboard'. The entries on the table have 3 fields; 'name', 'score' and 'time', where 'name' is the primary key. The database is stored on [Hasura Cloud](https://hasura.io/). The Netlify functions interface with the database using [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/).

New entries are added using [Hasura's](https://hasura.io/) "upsert" method. If the client tries to add an entry with a name that already exists in the database, the database overwrites the score and the time of the existing entry. Therefore, a name can be used by multiple players which can lead to collusions and partial loss of progress. Unfortunately, it is not possible to have user verification without a proper sign-in feature. Sign-in is left out since such a feature would be overkill for a basic arcade style game.

### Tech Stack

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
- [Hasura](https://hasura.io/)
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)

### To-Do

- Add try-catch blocks to every API call

- Input validation (name & score) validation at [insertScore.js](./functions/insertScore.js)
- Migrate in-line CSS to [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) or [CSS Modules](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-a-css-modules-stylesheet/)
- Stylize [Question component](./src/components/Quiz/question.js)
- Reveal correct answer after each round
- Colorcode question difficulties (Yellow, Orange, Red)
- Reconfigure font sizes for responsiveness (Especially for iPad)
- Add CSS Transformations/Animations to taste
- 2nd Pass at Accessibility

## How to Play

### Stay in the fight

Trivia Fighter Turbo presents you arcade style trivia in a web browser! Compete in upto 20 rounds of multiple choice questions to get the highest score and put your name on the leaderboard.

Game is over if you guess wrong or if you run out of time.

Trivia Fighter Turbo gets its questions from [Open Trivia DB](https://opentdb.com/). Be prepared for questions from +20 different categories!

### Stronger the opponent, bigger the prize

Questions come at random difficulty levels, at every new round. Fortune might favor you with a flurry of easy questions or one difficult opponent might be your end. On the bright side, harder questions yield more points!

- Easy = 100 Points
- Medium = 200 Points
- Hard = 500 Points

### Keep an eye out for time

Every round 10 more seconds are added to your timer. If the timer runs out before you can answer a question, game is over. Use the time wisely if you want to reach the top!

### Make History

Beat other fighters' scores to put your name on the map. Check the leaderboard frequently to see if you still qualify for the top 10.

**Disclaimer: It might take a refresh or two for your name to show up on the leaderboard**

## üöÄ Quick start

1.  **Install the Dependencies.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the default starter.

    ```shell
    npm install -g gatsby-cli
    npm install netlify-cli -g
    ```

1.  **Start Playing.**

    ```shell
    cd trivia-fighter-web
    npm install
    netfliy dev
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and play!**

    The site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    \_Note: Netlify will serve your functions from a different port than 8000. Keep an eye out for a message like "Functions server is listening on 53088". You can use your own browser or an application like Postman to test the endpoints.\_
